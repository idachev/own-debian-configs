! Following the suggestion from the following link:
! https://dev.to/0xbf/remap-keys-in-the-keyboard-in-ubuntu-5a36
! Check command: xev
! For XF86ScrollDown/XF86ScrollUp we need:
! sudo apt-get install xbindkeys xvkbd xautomation
! Also we need the file ~/.xbindkeysrc
keycode 122 = XF86ScrollDown
keycode 123 = XF86ScrollUp
